Apodidonai is greek for the act of  "giving back."  The act of Apodidonai manifests itself in the physical activity giving back to a person, people, community, country, or the world.

The aim of Apodidonai is to give people access to a type of giving that is not Philanthropy.

Philanthropy (a word that dates back to about 1623) means "the desire to promote the welfare of others, expressed especially by the generous donation of money to good causes"

The point of entry for this concept of giving may be priced too high, and as such, many people today may find it difficult to be "philanthropic." 

Only five of the countries in the 2015's World Giving Index Top 20 are members of the G20 (a group representing the world's largest economies). Eleven G20 countries are ranked outside of the Top 50, and of these eleven, three are even outside the Top 100\.

Although the US is in the Top 20 of the World Giving Index, in 2015, only 68% of american people donated money.  By comparison, 91% of the people in Myanmar donated money to worthwhile causes.

While both developed and developing economies have seen a slight decrease in donating money, transitioning economies have seen an increase in this behavior.

This says that a large, wealthy economy is not necessarily one that supports philanthropy and that philanthropy is mainly supported by an agreement imposed by culture and religion.

Apodidonai changes the conversation of what it means to donate to good causes."

By taking the money out of the conversation around giving and inviting people to participate in Apodidonai, participants are moved, touched, and inspired.

The simple act of being cause in the matter of people lives is an ever present reminder of what it means to be a person in humanity.
